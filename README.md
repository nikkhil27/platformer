🎮 Mario-Style 2D Platformer in C (Raylib)

A Mario inspired 2D platformer built from scratch in C using Raylib, focusing on low-level game programming concepts such as game loops, physics, animation state management, camera systems, and tile-based level rendering.

This project was developed to deeply understand how games work under the hood, without relying on heavy engines like Unity or Unreal.
